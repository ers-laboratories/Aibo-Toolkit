![](https://github.com/ers-laboratories/Aibo-Toolkit/blob/main/images/app.png?raw=true)
####Aibo Toolkit is an application being developed to run on the Aibo ERS 1000 itself, it is intended to allow Aibo to be configured without the cloud ( modified ERS 1000 required ), it is also intended to offer the ability to customize Aibo and interact with it through a convenient and modern Python-based interface and NiceGUI.

### Features (Early Alpha)
- Reading data from Aibo
- Configuration of language, eyes, gender, name 
- Sending Aibo API commands locally
- Interacting with AIBO via the Playfull Aibo tab
- A library of documents on AIBO
- Easier to find Aibo service technicians
- Easier to find accessory stores

### All of the features listed above will be implemented when custom software for the ERS 1000 comes out, currently the application only works running on a computer.
